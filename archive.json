The P-CS-computed CATS routes will be distributed among the overlay CATS-Routers, and will not affect the underlay nodes.\r\n\r\nThis reads like a pretty strong statement. It not only assumes that CATS routers are distinct from IP/MPLS routers of the underlay (which is highly debatable). It also asssumes that CATS routers will not affect (whatever that means) undermlay nodes: it seems to me that LIBs and FIBs maintaintes by PE routers (for example) may very well be populated by P-CS-computed routes (at least I fail to understand why not). So, I thi\u00e7nk this should deserve some elaboration. In addition, the IP/MPLSunderlay could contribute to the improvement of C-PS-computed routes (e.g., by means of Segment Routing). So, I don't think the underlay/overlay is that black and white.",

I guess network state can be define using existing solutions/metrics. The question is, do we expect in CATS to define something in this respect on how to feed the C-NMA or what kind of existing information/metrics the C-NMA will lever on, or not? If not, probably we can state that C-NMA is expected to use existing solutions/metrics, maybe providing some reference as well, and concentrate on C-SMA. ",

Centralized designs where the computing-related metrics from the C-SMAs are collected by a (logically) centralized path computation logic (like a Path Computation Element (PCE) {{?RFC4655}}) that also collects network metrics may, thus, be adopted. In the latter case, the (logically) centralized CATS computation logic may process incoming service requests to compute and select paths let alone service instances.
